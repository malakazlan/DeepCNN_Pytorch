# DeepCNN_Pytorch

This repository demonstrates building deep convolutional neural network (DeepCNN) layers completely from scratch in PyTorch—without leveraging the built-in nn.Module or high-level abstractions. All components, including layers and forward/backward passes, are implemented manually for educational purposes.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Implement and train a deep neural network from scratch using only PyTorch tensors and operations, without using `nn.Module` or any high-level neural network utilities.
- **Dataset:** Breast cancer dataset with shape (144, 30) — 144 samples, each with 30 features.
- **Architecture Used:**
  - **Input:** 30 features
  - **Hidden Layer 1:** 4 neurons
  - **Hidden Layer 2:** 3 neurons
  - **Hidden Layer 3:** 2 neurons
  - **Output Layer:** 1 neuron, sigmoid activation

## Key Highlights

- **No Use of `nn.Module`**: All neural network components are hard-coded, providing hands-on understanding of the underlying mechanics.
- **Manual Forward and Backward Passes:** From weight initialization to backpropagation, every aspect is implemented from scratch.
- **Educational Focus:** Ideal for those wanting to learn how neural networks work under the hood, beyond auto-differentiation and high-level APIs.

## Results

- **Accuracy Achieved:** 62% (without any hyperparameter tuning, using raw learning).
